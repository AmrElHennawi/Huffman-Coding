# Huffman-Coding

## Overview
This project implements a file compression and decompression tool using Huffman coding. Huffman coding is a widely used algorithm for lossless data compression. The implementation includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.

## Features
- **Compression and Decompression:** The tool provides functionality to compress and decompress files using Huffman coding.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The application comes with a GUI to make it easy for users to interact with the compression and decompression functions.

- **File Selection:** Users can choose input and output files using the GUI, simplifying the compression and decompression process.

## How to Use

### GUI Interface
1. **Input File:** Enter the path of the file you want to compress or decompress in the "Input File Name" field.

2. **Output File:** Enter the desired output file name in the "Output File Name" field.

3. **Choose File Button:** Click the "Choose File" button to open a file dialog and select the input file.

4. **Compress Button:** Click the "Compress" button to compress the selected file.

5. **Decompress Button:** Click the "Decompress" button to decompress the selected file.

6. **Exit Button:** Close the application by clicking the close button on the window.
